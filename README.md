# maldua-pimbra - Patched Zimbra repos (Main repo)

This organisation will have patched Zimbra repos with security and other important fixes.

Some of these repos will be fetched from [Zimbra FOSS Builder](https://github.com/maldua/zimbra-foss-builder).

In the future we might add some scripts to this repo so that we are able to find or create this differences from Zimbra Network Edition binaries.
This is similar to what this [Zimbra.org forum thread: FOSS - How to patch/build source to include missing commits for 10.1.5/6](https://forums.zimbra.org/viewtopic.php?t=73348) describes.
